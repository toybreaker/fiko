# CLASSLESS VERSION

FIKO provides a `fiko.classless.css` version. In this version, `header`, `main` and `footer` act as containers. It does not integrate any helpers or utilities. Use this version if you need centred viewports:

Or use the `fiko.fluid.classless.css` version if you need a fluid container.


# LIMITATIONS

FIKO can be used without custom CSS for quick or small projects. However, it’s designed to provide a starting point, like a “reset CSS on steroids”. Developing with `fiko.css` require modern CSS knowledge to add any custom look.


### BROWSER SUPPORT

FIKO is designed and tested for the latest stable Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Safari releases. It does NOT support any version of IE, including IE 11.
